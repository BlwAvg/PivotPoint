This is the minified Guacamole JavaScript client from the Apache Guacamole project. You can:

Download the compiled/minified file from a distribution of Guacamole or from GitHub.

Place it in the public/guacamole/ folder as guacamole-common-min.js.


For example, if you have the full Guacamole 1.4.0+ distribution, youâ€™ll find a minified file named something like guacamole-common-js-1.4.0.min.js. Rename it if you wish. Just be sure to update the <script src="guacamole/guacamole-common-min.js"></script> path in index.html.
